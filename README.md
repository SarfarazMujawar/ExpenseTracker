# ExpenseTracker App

ExpenseTracker is a simple and intuitive application to track your income and expenses. This app is built using ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS. It leverages React's `createContext`, `useState`, and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and uses the browser's `localStorage` to save and reload transactions.

## Features

- **Add Income and Expenses:** Easily add your income and expense transactions.
- **View Transaction History:** View your transaction history, segregated into income and expenses.
- **Persistent Data:** Transactions are saved in the browser's localStorage, so your data persists even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and clean UI.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS:** For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application.
- **localStorage:** For storing transactions in the browser.
